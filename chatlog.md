# Project Chat Log

## [2024-12-19 15:30] - Project Migration Planning
**User:** Requested migration from Colab notebook to local Cursor development environment with models deployed on Colab via localtunnel
**Actions:** 
- Created tasks.md with 12 migration tasks
- Created chatlog.md for tracking interactions
- Created PRD.md for project requirements
- Created rules.md for development guidelines
**Notes:** User wants to move from single notebook to modular architecture with proper software engineering practices. Models (Mistral-7B and sentence-transformers) will be deployed on Colab and accessed via localtunnel to avoid local resource constraints.

## [2024-12-19 15:45] - Documentation Privacy Update
**User:** Requested to remove references to context and rule files from README and add them to gitignore as they are personal interaction files
**Actions:**
- Updated .gitignore to exclude only contexto/ directory and chatlog.md
- Removed references to personal interaction files from README.md
- Updated project structure documentation to focus on project files only
- Updated documentation section to reference standard project documentation
**Notes:** README now focuses purely on the project itself, while personal interaction files are properly excluded from public repository.
